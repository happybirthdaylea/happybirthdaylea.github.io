                <p> I have known you for 8 years now, from the day you walked into class back in school, up untill this very day today. Today, November 12 2019, you are turning 26, and for all the years I've known you, you have been growing smarter, wiser, stronger, kinder and unexplainably more beautiful.</p>
                <p> We are now physically far appart, but there's nothing I wouldn't give to be with you on your special day (and every other day). The past year was a rough one for us, but my feelings for you haven't changed one bit. I still love you beyond measure and I wouldn't imagine my life without you in it. You have been constantly been the support, love and guidance in my life and you have helped me grow and mature as a person.</p>
                <p> On this special day, I want to take the opportunity to make you a promise for the future to always be there for you, treasure you, show you how much I love and appreciate you, help you grow as a person and be the best you can be and support with your decisions, and give you the guidance you need (if you need it).</p>
                <p> You are a very unique person Lea. You have a combination of amazing traits that are at the basis of greatness. I believe in you and I belive your ability to do what you set your mind to, and I belive that your future will hold nothing but greatness for you.</p>
                <p> So on this wonderful day, I wish you a Happy Birthday full of joy, love and blessings to you and your family.</p>
                <br/>
                <p> I'm counting the days till I see you again.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Your number one fan,</p>
                <p>Phil</p>
